1. __Add item__ - it adds a new item to the shopping list and title the name of the item.

2. __Remove item__ - it enables to remove an item from the shopping list. Only a part of the name can be typed, eg. 'br' to remove 
'bread rolls'. Be aware, that if more than one item matches the input string, all the matched items will be deleted.

3. __Clear the list__ - it delets all the items from the list. This action is not reversable.
